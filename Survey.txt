What do you think is good about UCR?
1. I like how we have votes, and we are a democracy. I appreciate that all the High Ranks are kind to the lower ranks such as me. 
2. I think what good abo UCR is we are a very active clan and skilled fighters.
3. What i think is good is the Election,And Officer exam System.
4. UCR is good at sword fighting.
5. We have loyal members and great leaders.
6. I think the good thing in UCR is that we have a lot of trainings and raids.
7. I have to say I enjoy the administrative portion of UCR. It's quite effective.
8. I think that the fact that we're active,always training and raiding,is pretty good.
9. The bases, technology, and the activity from members as well as keeping the historic clan theme alive.
10. Great clan, very organized, excellent fighters, awesome high ranks.
11. its good have all groups as a clan.
12. UCR is united and historical. The Council alone acts like the Council of C&G itself.
13. Respectable HRs and great leaders such as you. (You should still be leader of UCR)
14. UCR members show respect,loyalty,and great skills.
15. Most of the HRs,most of the members
16. Mostly everything, I can't think of anything that isn't negative.
17. I think UCR is good because unlike other groups, it offers a fair chance for anyone to participate
18. The good things about UCR are the friendly HRs who are always there to help LRs.
19. UCR is very friendly, it welcomes new-comers very well and makes them comfortable on UCR.
20. I think that there is a lot of potential to be had from UCR and that we have many good people in our group.

What do you think is bad?
1. I dislike the number of members that tend to show up at defends. Also, at raids we tend to have few men, yet at trainings we fill up the server. That just bugs me a littlebit.
2. I think there is noting bad about UCR.
3. What i think is bad is our most of Our High Ranks are not showing good Examples to the new members of UCR. Such as Goofing off, Team killing just to be funny,And Flameing
4. I think you can improve by getting more soldiers on the feild.
5. The practices are un-orginized and sometimes admin abuse
6. The bad thing is that some people don't deserve their rank.
7. The military aspect may be lacking. Unfortunately I have yet to see a great example of UCR military might. 
8. The bad thing is that too much exploiters,and we don't use teamwork often.
9. The High Ranks.. I only care for a few, and they seem inactive or they are just for example Vortex Security HRs that just joined to check in on their ally. Cake is a great leader, but no one can replace you (TDF)
10. I've met very arrogant people in UCR. One of them was victor(some numbers here :/). He was an officer I think, and he kept rubbing his skills in everyone's faces calling us weak, etc. (that's really the only flaw I've seen in UCR in some time)
11. but the bad thing is a lot of the groups are at war with each other 
even though they are allied with UCR.
12. Too many alliances, less wars. Base activity leaning towards inactivity.
13. Its easy to get ranks now it should be a bit harder and not enough trains.
14. (no answer)
15. Our military and our activity.
16. The inactivity of UCR members.
17. UCR needs to improve on the divisions. They be everywhere without anybody in them, just floatin' o.e
18. I honestly can't think of a bad thing about UCR.
19. We have been hack a LOT recently, so we need more security. Also, I think we need to get some discipline back from the earlier eras, people need to respect the HRs and eachother a lot more.
20. Our leaders are abusive and need training, they don't need to be spamming the shout and demoting people for not attending a meeting if they aren't even online.

How can we improve?
1. Host more raids, parols, rather than trainings. So more like, hanging out at the Fort waiting for a raid.
2. We can improve with more members and skills.
3. How i think we can improve that is just pull them all together in a meeting and say to take this stuff seriously.
4. (no answer)
5. Make a place that has scripts to help with the tournaments and have one leader you know won't admin abuse to control admins.
6. UCR can improve by finding new forms of recruit and thinking about the rank of people that don't deserve it.
7. You'll want to see some better militarization, as well as stable ownership. Keep Cake in power and don't let that change. 
8. Since most of our servers have been exploited,maybe we should try to find who's been exploiting and ban them or something,and more training on teamwork.
9. Focus on members, train and fight wars when it makes sense. UCR should be similar to the United Nations in real life. They are the Police-ing force of Roblox.
10. Put victor in Diciplinary and Obediance...
11. u could get the clan to have no inter-war when allied to UCR.
12. Get UCR to the front page again. Get involved in more wars. As an excuse have "keeping the peace" as one. Wars bring activity and members.
13. Do more training sessions atleast every HRs do one 2 times a week and i think every week you pick one non HR to host a train just 1 and the leader of UCR picks they host a train on someones training map (This is just an idea so everyone can get really into UCR and enjoy it even more than it is now.)
14. UCR needs to host more trainings so other members can improve thier skills.
15. The HRs should have more events and new forms of training.
16. Advertise more on places and the forum.
17. You should delete some of them from UCR.
18. (no answer)
19. I think we need to take discipline and policy a little more seriously in UCR, that way the new member will know what we expect of them.
20. Be stricter on High Rank powers, who is given them, etc.

What should stay the same?
1. I like the High Ranks, I don't think any should be demoted. Also, I think we should remain as a democracy and keep having votes.
2. TDfall and coulor theory should stay owner and HR.
3. What can stay the same, Is not having to many trainings a day.
4. I think Urion should stay, maby even update it a bit.
5. Keep the HQ's and places with lots of secrets. I LOVE SECRETS
6. The trainings should stay the same because the trainers are good. When i entered UCR on August, I didn't know nothing about SFing. now i'm good.
7. Keep Cake. He's cool. Don't eliminate the group dynamics and the level of morals that I know UCR runs on. 
8. The system should stay the same,though.
9. The historic clan theme, and the bases.
10. Everything in UCR is doing awesome in my opinion. Hope this clan runs for 10 more centuries.
11. the maps should be slightly updated sometimes too.
12. The logo and unity. Everything else must start changing.
13. Ranks,Main Fort.
14. UCR needs to stay strong and never give up and have respect for there HRs and other members.
15. Elections.
16. Everything.
17. You can stay the same by keeping UCR school :D
18. The High Ranks, definitely.
19. I think we should definitely keep the family prospect of UCR, the HRs are much better than before - More active, more respectful.UCR doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be brilliant.
20. Continue to have fun and be old and glorious.

1-14 was from the first poll
15-20 from the second poll

First impressions: MANY more responses when I directly PMed 80 advanceds. This furthers my theory that many UCR are active but simply do not read the shout often enough. We should pursue certain strategies (TBD) to get them to read the shout more. Additionally, the people who responded to the shout tended to screw up the format more often or post unintelligible responses.
