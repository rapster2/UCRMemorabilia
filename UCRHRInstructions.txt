=============================

1. Getting Started

Congratulations! You're a high rank now! Don't worry about whether you've been with UCR since August 2009 or you joined ROBLOX in 2012, all that matters now is that you've proven yourself, either to me or to the people of the clan, and received a high rank as reward for your hard work. As a high rank, you're going to have to hold yourself to a higher standard. You now have responsibility for the entire clan. Don't worry, though - this responsiblity is shared by all your fellow senators and councils. 

Ah ah eee eee!

You might be wondering why I just imitated a monkey call. That's a memory device that will help you remember this acronym:

A bility
A ctivity
E fficiency
E ffectiveness

Those four words should define what you do for UCR as a high rank. Every one of your actions should go towards maintaining or improving one of those categories. Here are some examples: Improve ability by practicing your swordfighting; maintain activity by shouting patrols at ORION; improve efficiency by suggesting a rule change for elections; improve effectiveness by holding a discipline training.

Keep this in mind and success is certain.

AND CHECK YOUR DAMN INBOX. And while I'm always going to read and respond to your messages, don't spam the hell out of me.

=============================



=============================

2. Conduct

UCR is a very laid-back clan. Our rules are simple and the punishments are lenient. We like to promote a healthy atmosphere in UCR. However, the maintenance of said atmosphere requires that there are those who will keep the peace. Just like in modern society, if there was no police, crime would run rampant. For this reason, high ranks should know when to be relaxed and when to lay down the law.

Check the wall often. If you see members having an argument, generally you should let them be, or add your own input. Sometimes, though, it's going to be a judgment call. Are they using all caps? Are they insulting each other? If this happens, just post "Guys, calm down." Don't make any demotions. Make sure to check back in ten minutes or so to see if the argument is continuing. Only if your order is disobeyed should you demote the members.

In general, give out easy promotions to the really low ranks and difficult ones to mid-ranks. Intrepid bought the uniform and said "Hello sir"? Give him rank 2. Select participated in a successful defense? No promotion. Did that select win with 3 UCR against 13 raiders? Give him rank 5.

Over time, you'll learn the balance between discipline and friendliness, between maturity and fun. Try to use good grammar as often as possible. If you aren't the best english student, just do whatever you feel most comfortable with. ROBLOXians respect those who can type out a coherent sentence.

"Hey guys, what's up?"
makes a better impression than
"hey gys wassap?"

Of course, when you're around friends feel free to do whatever you like. The point is that UCR members should have something to aspire to, and you should set an example. As a high rank, one of your most important jobs is to inspire the members to do better. Be encouraging and help the low ranks succeed - who knows, maybe one of your new intrepid friends might someday be a senator, too. 

=============================



=============================

3. The shout

Ahh, the shout. One of the most useful tools for a clan. If you've never had a high rank before, you probably won't know how to treat the shout box (and if you have, you might just be a terrible HR and can't make a decent shout for your life, lol).

In the shoutbox, grammar is 100% necessary all the time. No exceptions.
Never clear the shout (press the enter shout button without typing in text). It screws up the shouting schedule. Even though it doesn't show your name in the group, there are ways for me to find out.
Use the shout tags posted on UCRCentral's profile.
Don't spam the shout.
Don't fight over using the shout.
If you want to overshout someone, ask the HR first.
On election day/nomination day keep the forum link in the shout all day. If it's not there, put it there.

The ONLY time you can overshout early without permission is in the event of a SERIOUS emergency. "WE NEED BACKUP AT ORION ASAP" is an emergency. "COME TO MY TRAINING" is not.

Remember that it's the job of high ranks to shout often. Don't shout pointless things - figure out something to do and shout it. For example, the clan won't go to a training on its own - it needs to be shouted.

=============================



=============================

4. Holding a training.

High ranks should shout trainings at least once every other day. Anything less is unsatisfactory. If you don't know where to hold training or what type of training to hold, just post on the wall. In a few minutes at most a member will probably reply saying "I want sword training!" or "I want training at blahblah's place!" Even if you don't have a place of your own to hold training, you can ask a fellow HR to help you out. Remember to make sure you have admin there first.

At a training, things can get hectic fast. Don't worry about members chatting up a storm while you speak. Just use m/ to get your message across. If they're disobeying you REPEATEDLY, use the kill/ command. Only use kick/ on repeat offenders. Never use ban/ unless there is someone deliberately trying to sabotage the training (spammer, random killer, etc.). Wait until you get at least 15 men in the server or 15 minutes after you shouted to start training.

Different types of trainings you want to consider include FFA, tournament, and instruction. There are many other ways to train soldiers, but these are the most common.

FFA requires the least effort on your part - those are the "50 kills for a promotion" sort of things. In the changing clan world, though, we want to make sure our members are not just quantitatively good but qualitatively good. What that means is, instead of "50 kills for a promotion," do "50 kills and a K/D over 1 for a promotion." In that way we can get strong troops.

In a training, you're going to have to keep tight control over the members. You're going to pit them face to face against each other. Line them up and have them go two at a time or more fighting each other. MAKE SURE YOU SAY FF/ALL! If you don't a random guy can run up and screw up your whole line. Give promotions to the top few who make it all to the semis.

Instruction trainings require total control. You should make sure the members are always FFed. Demonstrate to them all at once the techniques they need to become better at a particular skill. Make sure you are clear and use repetition and summary to show them all the techniques. Then, one-by-one teach the members your tips. Make sure to keep chatter down, but let them ask questions freely.

Note: Do not hold training geared solely towards discipline unless you have my permission. I don't want members to rage because a high rank did it wrong and banned people for being one step off the line.

=============================



=============================

5. Holding a meeting

A meeting is a relationship between a speaker and a listener. It's their duty to listen carefully and quietly and your duty to present the information in a clear manner. Make sure your audience understands this, and don't forget it yourself.

Holding a meeting is possibly the hardest basic HR job you will ever do. Meetings can go nuts REALLY fast, faster than even the most chaotic training. Just one question can throw you off. Be prepared. Despite the risk, meetings are extremely beneficial for UCR members because they help keep everyone in-the-know and boost member morale. Hold a meeting every week. Promotion meetings, where you ask members why they might deserve a promotion, are good too. Maggiore is a good meeting place that I personally own.

MAKE SURE you have admin at the meeting place. You will need to enforce discipline throughout the meeting using kill/, kick/, and ban/. If talking gets out of control, you will have to reestablish order. Start by saying "m/I will start using kill/ on anybody who continues to talk." If talking doesn't stop, start kicking the talkers. Make it clear that spamming "sorry" or "i have a question" is just as bad as "what's up" or "hi." Tell them that if they have questions, they can stand up in front of their chairs, SILENTLY. Ban only if necessary.

When you hold a meeting, make sure to use grammar at all times. Come prepared, with an outline of what you're going to talk about. Stick to that outline, but if questions redirect the meeting, let the members guide you. If the questions start getting really off-topic (ex. a meeting on war going from "Who are we going to war with?" to "Are we getting a new base?") just say "that's enough for questions and get back on track."

Keep your calm and get the message out. Remember that there are always those who will respect the rules and not speak out.

6. Aspiring for more

Many high ranks believe that they have maxed themselves out, that they can no longer rank up. Senators feel like they're just defending their ranks and councils feel like they're going to sit there for all eternity. Just remember that every President is going to retire some day, and if you've done a good job as a high rank, you're in the running. I wouldn't just consider Vice Presidents because any HR could become a Vice President.

Don't let your inner ambition die out. The clan is our work of art, and it's up to you to help make it a masterpiece. So long as ORION doesn't get 10000 visits a day, UCR doesn't grow 1000 members a day, and the average IQ of our members isn't 160, our mission is not yet complete. As a high rank, you now share the responsibility of keeping UCR on track and improving it. 

There are fundamental differences between high ranks and low ranks. The low ranks simply want to improve themselves, vying for promotions and learning new skills. High ranks should view the success of the clan as their battle, the improvement of clan society as their campaign. XF me for a good time. I want to fondle your genitals. Don't tell anyone else about this part, it's our little secret. Anyway, as a high rank you're going for a more general, long-term goal. Getting that rank isn't the end. There are so many ways to succeed on ROBLOX. For example, Dylan2225 recently started investing in hats, and now he's ridiculously rich. Rulzalot learned how to script and now he's one of the top developers on ROBLOX. Don't assume you've reached the end of the road.

There is always more. Time ticks by and opportunities present themselves. You could someday be the President of UCR.

7. Staying active

It might get difficult to stay active doing the same job over and over again. I'm going to tell you a story from my personal experience.

In November 2010, I was appointed SiC of RAT. I started to get many PMs and xfire chats in addition to my already prolific foruming. This took up so much of my time, but a certain laziness settled in. I would rarely go to games because I didn't feel like entering servers. I didn't build either. Then, after about a month and a half of this, I realized that, with such an important role, I had to be in direct contact with ALL the members. I began to go to the bases frequently. Even if I was AFK at the base because I was reading xfire chats or foruming, I could still check in and answer a question from a curious new recruit. You can't converse with these people when you're somewhere else. Soon, I became known as the most active admiral and a friend of many new and rising members. Because I had decided to be active instead of laying about, my base of support grew even larger.

Of course, this eventually backfired because CT grew weary of all the calls for him to retire and started taking it out on me. I can assure you that we have opposite personalities, lol. 

There are also many different videogames available that can distract you from your HR role. I don't blame you. Afterwind, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Skyrim, Fallout, and others are all great games. Go off and do whatever you like. Just, please, remember your family - they'll get worried when you spend 36 straight hours on the XBOX. Remember your other family, too. UCR will always be there for you.

Activity has rewards in and of itself. If you want to truly succeed as a HR, make your presence distinct. You represent UCR now. Stay active, stay awesome.




And remember - 
Ah ah eee eee!

Thanks for reading this and good luck.
