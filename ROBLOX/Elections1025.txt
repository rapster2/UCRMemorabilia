-----------------------
Some of you might find it funny or perhaps scary when I shout 'Go to the meeting or be demoted"
but I do this because I know there are some UCR Hrs who are inactive that they won't even check the shout
and I will know who demote.

Now let's begin.

Three Topics
1.A new UCR Division
2.Activty and Discipline
3.Succession

XxX Propsed the other day that we have the UCR Army
and much to my disappointment he cancelled the project.
I commend you for your ideas, XxX and we will now implement them
We are going to have a new UCR Division that is based off
Being orderly, disciplined and able to defend forts.

This group will likely be free to join
it will be organized into differnt battalions
Believe we shall have a differnt battalion for each VP
So, there should be 4 Battalions in total

For TD, Cake and Trick.
Since hacker won't be able to mange his battlaion his battalion slot will be for training
Each battlaion will have differnt tasks
And will have no more than 100 members in each
To start off there will be a constest for 1000 Rbx or something
 equivalent to NBCers to get most people in a battalion.

Each Battalion will have a differnt role
Trainign battlaion which is suppose to be done by H1L will be managed by XxXMasterMindXxX
Make sure all soldiers know how to behave
Propritize Discipline training at that level I will instruct you on how to train them you may choose a name for your battlaion
other battalions will probably have roles such as raiding defending and parading

Activity and Discipline
Must take initiative to teach soldiers

If they don't listen and you don't tell them they won't learn
You can't just tell a guy 'DEFEND THE DOOR' because that's open to interpretation
When working with an undisciplained member you have to make sure they know exactly what to do
say 
"DEFEND THE DOOR UNTIL I COME BACK. USE YOUR GUN ONLY'
When I tell disciplined members to make a formation they know exactly what to do
When I tell undisciplined members to make a formation I have to align them manually
it's the simple fact that the discip[lined ones KNOW
the others DONT thefore you have to tell them

Boom said 'He can't teach all the members on hsi own and that gives him an excuse to complain'
I think the exact same thing sometimes

The simple fact is All of you are High ranks and all you have the job of improving the LRs in whatever ways
Saying you can't do it alone is NOT an excuse
If 30 people all agree they can't do it alone them why don't they work together
Let's work together to improve UCR
Everybody has to contribute their share

Last topic

Succession is a transfer of power from the leader to the heir
This past week I've been pretty inactive palying other stuff
Why don't I just hand it over now, take a break?

Now, I know what I think
Yesterday decision
I am NOT stepping down
I know for a fact I can only keep up with this so much I mean
in my entire ROBLOX career I have taken time off to play other stuff
I don't spend all my time on this game, or any game for that matter
Last year in Auguest I quit for about 2 months
I never actually said I quit but I didn't want to go back to it I just wanted to play CoD
I came back, of course
When I take time off I come back to reinvigorate
I left came back and got Rat SiC right before I got UCR, in fact
You might know about all that turmoil that I faced and I did take some time off to play MC
and I came back, pucked up my activity did what I needed to be done and I got UCR.

Simple to say, everybody needs a rest, I've taken it and I'm ready to go

I know some leaders who have taken breaks then come back and done better than before
trick of course, had alot of trouble leading UCR at times,
because he couldn't  stay active
In the first 2 months after I got UCR he did almost nothing
Then he relized that he actually wanted to help the clan
and now he's supporting us in many ways, albeit dealing with school, too

I am telling you now HRs I will not let you down I will not let the Clan down
If you need to take a break go do it
but make sure you remember where your family lies here, in UCR
so you can come back stronger than before
I want these armies set up
UCR's been witnessing steady imporvement
People list us as one of the top three clans now
It's time we start picking up our pace
So, to conclude
Those of you who have been taking notes good job send the notes to me over xF
