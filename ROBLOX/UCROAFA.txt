The recent reemergence of the infamous x-101st has stirred an ancient force in the clan world. LordVade, the leader, has platformed the majority of his operations off nostalgia in the clan world. However, overzealous and aggressive as lordnathan had been, Vade has overstepped his bounds and will now face elimination by the United Clan of Roblox, this time permanently.

Initially, we had not planned to war this clan, despite the cries of many to reinvigorate old rivalries. However, through continued hostile actions taken by the x-101st towards UCR and its allies, we must intervene. RAA, NFC, and RNW have all seen their positions under fire by the barbaric forces of the x-101st. LordVade has also hinted at threats of violence against UCR. This will no longer be tolerated.

To defend the Supreme Alliance, UCR will mobilize its armies and assault this dishonorable clan. Additionally, other alliance clans will be encouraged to participate in the conflict.

Moreover, we invite every veteran of the 2009 United Clan of Roblox to participate, with a fresh start and new opportunity. Certainly, those with the most experience fighting this enemy will prove to be the most helpful in the coming weeks. We extend this welcoming hand and will, this January, hold "Veterans Month" to celebrate UCR's heritage with respect and honor to those who served in the first x-101st war. Kinglime's Underwater Base will be set up as a raiding position in reverence. Additionally, we will raid in the classic uniform.

The x-101st stands no chance.
Legendary, mighty, family.
Once and for all.
