I found out just a few minutes ago that I was demoted in FEAR, to GEN, from a fellow leader. He said to me that there was an admin attack, and I was the only leader online. I checked the wall, and saw that you posted this. 

I attest that there is absolutely NO way that this is possible. I hate to say it, but your eyes must have deceived you. I can confirm right now two things:

There was an admin attack on 10/14, during which many low ranks were demoted. During this time I checked the ranks to see how many were in each, and I know FOR A FACT that there were 170 officers. After reading your post and seeing the circumstances surrounding it, I checked the ranks, and it was in the mid-180s. There is no evidence of any demotion here, at least during this time period.

Secondly, I was not online at all this morning. I logged off last night around 2:30 AM EST, and logged on today at 11:50 AM EST. According to wall posts, like this one here:

"wintersfury
@Shout, DC this my be liav hes the only leader on other then just go away but he spends his time with VS, I think liavs doing this
10/16/2011 9:54:41 AM"

I was not online, but liavkr. Also this one:

"flaminwolf123
I don't trust many people. But I only trust two of the leaders online, DC and Jason. No offense Liavkr, you just weren't active for a while and it takes time to gain some trust.
10/16/2011 10:03:00"

Then I saw your post.

"TDFall was the only Leader online during the AA. So it's him...
10/16/2011 10:03:40 AM"

In Eastern Time, this would be at 11 AM. However, I had just woken up at 10:50 AM, and at 11 time the most likely action I was taking was rubbing sand out of my eyes. From that time until when I logged on at 11:50 AM, I had been talking to my grandparents, who had stayed over. My laptop is locked, so nobody could have gotten on it to AA.

==========================================

In conclusion, I will disregard this as simply a trick of your mind if you would kindly reinstate me at Leader. There is absolutely no possible way in which I could have AAed. I was not awake at the time, and other people blamed liavkr and doctorcooper, not me.

If this has anything to do with thekyleshredder, who many tell me "kisses up" to you, and may have accused me, then I will find no other resolution than to amass the cloud of support against his position, and force a rational discussion.

==========================================

I would hope that you realize that I of all people would be against admin attacking, and that I am one of the strongest voices in opposition to its practice. I oppose it as a form of sabotage, revenge, or any other justification. In leading UCR, I am constantly paranoid of an AA.

This is the only attempt I will make at reinstatement. If this literal "word-wall" cannot convince you of my innocence, then nothing can.

I will post this on the forums in case you do not read this message, as you have not replied to any of the messages I have sent in the past week.

the next one:

Hey SONIC,

I would like to be informed of the reason for my demotion in FEAR. I had received news that there was an admin attack, but I assure that I was not involved. I have been sick with a sinus infection since Tuesday, and up until today I haven't even gone on the site other than to talk to UCR high ranks about planning reforms.

My simple request is for the restoration of my Leader rank. You of all people should know that my role is best realized during a time of crisis in FEAR, through my ability to maintain calm and promote accountability. I additionally handle promotion requests from FEAR members, attend meetings, and am clearly the allied leader with the most time invested in your clan.

Thank you,
TDFall
