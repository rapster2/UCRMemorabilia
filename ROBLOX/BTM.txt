You shall successfully cause chaos and rebellion in the BTMpire. There is nothing that can stop your progress from eliminating BTMpire power once and for all.

-={[First]}=- Use your admin powers to do random promotions and demotions. No matter what you do, NEVER let them find out that it was you who did it. To be most successful, do the admin attacks when many of the other high ranks are online. 
When demoting, work slowly over a few days to weeks. This will make Boba think that people are leaving the clans, and he will see the ranks getting smaller.
When promoting, promote in groups of 30 to 40 at a time, but vary the times you do it. Make sure to promote alts, too. Sometimes promote to the highest rank, sometimes to other ranks.

-={[Second]}=- Try to gain Bobatheman's trust. If boba trusts you more, he will give you more power. The more power you have, the more trouble you can make.
Also, if you have his trust, you can get spies into the high ranks. Win elections by sending out mass PMs to your clan members, and people in the rebellion. Get them to support the people you want to win, who will help you save RT.

-={[Third]}=- Do NOT BE SUSPICIOUS. We rebels think this is the most important thing. Never act suspiciously. You have to convince yourself, and act like you are someone who isn't helping the rebels. Tell them things like "We will crush the rebels. They are fools who believe in chaos."

-={[Last]}=-
Spread this mesage around using alts with good names, like BTMpireCollapse. This is going out to every high rank in RT and the BTMpire. No matter who gets it, loyal or not. BTMpire will fail. RT will be saved, and so will all the other clans he bought out of their rightful owners.

This has been a message from the Savior of RT. Remember that fear is your best weapon.
Good luck.
